# How to Use
First Download both the Mimic-Engine folder and the renpy SDK folder from the repo. You will need to use renpy 3.5 for this project. Launch the renpy executable, either for Mac or Windows and select the Mimic Engine project. Now you all you need to do is just hit "Launch Project" in renpy.
